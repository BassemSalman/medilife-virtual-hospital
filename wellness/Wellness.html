        <p id="wbtxt">What is beauty to you? How you feel and how you look can have a lot to do with one another. Taking care of one area can often lead to benefits in the other. Beauty and wellness may not have clearly defined lines that divide them, but they both have pretty clearly defined benefits that connect them.</p>

                <h3>The way your client chooses to present their skin is entirely personal. Exposing or revealing their body can be both vulnerable and intimate. </h3>
                <p>Loving the skin you live in is undeniably important. Feeling good about the way you look has a lot to do with your skin, for obvious reasons. This means your client needs to feel good about how their skin looks and feels. 
                    They are the ones who should make the decisions about what skin treatments are right for them and which ones they would rather not try.
                    Most importantly, your client should be the one to make the choice about their body hair. Your client should decide if they want to even out their skin tone or leave it beautifully asymmetrical. 
                    If they like their freckles, their beauty mark or their leg hair they shouldn’t let anyone talk them out of showing them off.</p>

                <p><b>moisturizer</b>: use a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't block your pores for oily skin, and a more cream-based one for dry skin</p>
                <p><b>Serums</b>: A serum with vitamin C or growth factors or peptides would be better in the morning, under sunscreen. At night, retinol or prescription retinoids work best.</p>
